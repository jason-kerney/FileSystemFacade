## Introduction ##

In my professional life I am often thrown into a code base that is badly in need of testing. One of the things that constantly throws people is interaction with the filesystem. How do you test code that creates, modifies or deletes actual files. This library is in response to those experiences.

My hope is that this library makes testing those things easier and thereby enable safe refactoring.
